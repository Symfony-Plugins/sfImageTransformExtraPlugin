/**
 * Maps sfImageSource:// URLs to a remote image file
 *
 * This class only overrides the two stat methods and returns empty arrays.
 * stat/fstat is internally used by file_exists() which is called by sfImage.
 * It doesn't rely on stat information but on a positiv return.
 * Unfortunately stat and fstat do not work with URLs other than on the local
 * filesystem therefor these methods are faked in this class.
